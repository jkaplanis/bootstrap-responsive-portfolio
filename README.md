# Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Project Details

The goal of this project is to create three mobile responsive pages utilizing the Bootsrap framework. I have also attempted to use as little css as possible in an effort to showcase Bootstrap's robust capabilities. 

## Example of Bootstrap classes found in project:

class= "col-sm  my-auto d-flex justify-content-center justify-content-sm-start"


This particular set of classes assigned to a div will tell the child element to take up the entire row and center the content. When the the window reaches small (which Bootstrap defines as 576px) then the element will return to a column and the content will be justified to the start (left).
