          <p>After graduating from UC Santa Cruz in 2011, I began a career in hospitality with a focus on front office
            management. After spending a few years working in hotels I decided it was time for a change. In the years
            that followed I had the opportunity to work for a larger emerging growth company as well as a smaller
            startup.
          </p>
          <p>I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UCSD where I am developing the skills needed to become a
            full-stack web developer. I look forward to combining this new skillset with my previous experience in order
            to launch my new career.</p>
